# memb-curve

## Theory
<img src="images/sphere.jpg" alt="" width="300">
The aim of this programme is to determine a value for the local curvature of a membrane induced by the adsorption of an agent (protein, DNA, molecule, molecular aggregate, etc.) on its surface. The radius of curvature is identified through a spherical fit of the contacting moities at the membrane vicinity.
Three points A,B and C are considered:
